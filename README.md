# Michelbach_RetentionPond
Repository for the scripts used to derive the results of the analysis "Analysis of Nutrient Loading in a Small Retention Pond in Michelbach, Hesse, Germany".

This repository is part of the final submission of the course "Hydrogeography" of the M.Sc. Physical Geography. 


## Small Overview
We sampled a retention pond near Michelbach (50.842395°N, 8.700661°E) for around seven weeks starting at the end of May 2025, finishing in mid July 2025. During these seven weeks, we sampled the pond and its outflow on a weekly basis to check for a buffer effect of the retention pond on the nutrient loading of the incoming and outgoing water. In-situ, we measured nitrate and orthophosphate using a mobile photometer and afterwards measured the carbon content of the water samples in the GeoLab laboratory of the Department of Geography.
